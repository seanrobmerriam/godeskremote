# 70-Minute Therapy Session Outline

## Client Profile: 37-year-old woman, attorney/softball coach, post-gynecological surgery, ADHD, impulsive eating patterns, in couples counseling

-----

## Opening & Rapport Building (5-7 minutes)

**Script:**
“Welcome back. It’s good to see you. Before we dive in, how are you feeling today—both physically and emotionally?”

*[Allow response, listen attentively]*

“I’m glad you’re here. Since we last met, you’ve had your surgery and have been in recovery. I’m imagining there’s been a lot going on. What feels most important to talk about today?”

*[Note her priorities, validate]*

“I hear that [reflect her stated priority]. We’ll definitely make space for that. I’m also curious about how your recovery has been going, how things are with the ADHD strategies we discussed, and how couples counseling is progressing. Does it make sense to touch on those areas as well, or would you rather focus elsewhere?”

## Recovery & Physical Health Check-In (10-12 minutes)

**Script:**
“Let’s start with your recovery. How has the healing process been going since the surgery?”

*[Listen for physical symptoms, emotional responses, timeline concerns]*

**Follow-up questions:**

- “What has surprised you most about the recovery process—either easier or harder than expected?”
- “How have you been managing the balance between resting enough and staying active, especially with coaching responsibilities?”
- “What kind of support have you been getting? What’s been helpful, and what’s been missing?”

**Psychoeducation moment:**
“Recovery from gynecological surgery often affects people on multiple levels—not just physically. It’s common to experience emotional shifts, fatigue that feels disproportionate, or even grief about temporary limitations. This can be especially challenging for someone like you who’s used to being active and managing multiple responsibilities. Have you noticed any of these patterns for yourself?”

*[Validate her experience, normalize emotional responses]*

-----

## ADHD & Impulsive Eating During Recovery (12-15 minutes)

**Script:**
“I know managing ADHD and impulsive eating has been an ongoing focus for us. How has your recovery affected these patterns?”

*[Listen for changes in routine, medication, eating patterns, executive function]*

**Psychoeducation:**
“When our bodies are healing, a few things happen that can make ADHD management harder. First, pain and recovery fatigue tax our executive function—the very system that helps us pause before acting impulsively. Second, being less physically active can remove a key regulation tool. And third, we often turn to food for comfort or dopamine when other coping strategies aren’t available. Does any of that resonate with what you’ve experienced?”

**Follow-up questions:**

- “What has your eating looked like these past weeks? Any patterns you’ve noticed?”
- “Have you been able to use any of the strategies we discussed before the surgery, or has everything felt different?”
- “When you notice yourself eating impulsively, what usually comes right before that? What are you thinking, feeling, or needing in that moment?”
- “Your legal training taught you to analyze situations methodically. When you step back and look at your eating patterns like a case you’re examining, what do you notice about the evidence?”

**Skill-building:**
“Let’s think about your transition back to normal activity. What’s one small strategy you could experiment with this week that acknowledges where you are physically while supporting your ADHD management?”

*[Collaborate on realistic, specific behavioral experiment]*

-----

## Coaching Responsibilities & Identity (10-12 minutes)

**Script:**
“You’ve been away from coaching or working at reduced capacity during recovery. How has that been for you?”

*[Listen for identity concerns, guilt, relief, loss, team dynamics]*

**Follow-up questions:**

- “Coaching seems like such an important part of your identity—not just what you do, but who you are. What’s it been like to step back from that role?”
- “How have your players and assistant coaches managed? What feelings come up when you think about them handling things without you?”
- “Your legal career is one chapter, and now coaching is this other significant part of your life. What does softball coaching give you that law practice didn’t?”

**Psychoeducation:**
“Career transitions—even chosen ones—often involve grief alongside excitement. When we build our identity around competence and achievement, which both law and coaching reward, it can feel threatening when we have to accept limitations, even temporary ones. That’s not weakness; that’s being human.”

**Reflection prompt:**
“As you think about returning fully to coaching, what do you want to bring with you from this recovery period? What have you learned about yourself or your needs?”

-----

## Couples Counseling Integration (12-15 minutes)

**Script:**
“You mentioned you and your husband have been in couples counseling. How is that going?”

*[Listen for themes, progress, frustrations, dynamics]*

**Follow-up questions:**

- “What made you both decide this was the right time to start couples work?”
- “What’s been most helpful so far? What’s felt challenging or uncomfortable?”
- “How has your recovery affected your relationship? Has it brought you closer, created distance, or some of both?”
- “In couples sessions, what patterns or themes keep coming up?”

**Integration questions:**
“Sometimes what we work on individually connects to relationship dynamics. For example:”

- “How does your ADHD show up in your relationship? How does your husband respond to it?”
- “When you’re struggling with impulsive eating, how does that affect things between you two?”
- “Do you notice yourself falling into ‘lawyer mode’ in conflicts—building cases, cross-examining, defending? How does that work for you both?”

**Psychoeducation:**
“Individual therapy and couples counseling can work really well together when there’s good communication between the work you’re doing in each space. In here, we can focus on your individual patterns, self-understanding, and personal goals. In couples work, you’re learning relationship skills and navigating together. It sounds like you’re doing both, which takes courage and commitment.”

**Boundary check:**
“Is there anything from couples counseling that feels important to process here, or anything from our work that you’re wondering how to bring into that space?”

-----

## Synthesizing & Identifying Patterns (8-10 minutes)

**Script:**
“I want to take a step back with you and look at some threads I’m noticing. Tell me if this fits or if I’m missing something.”

*[Offer tentative observations that connect themes, for example:]*

“I’m noticing themes around control and competence—you’ve built a life around being skilled, prepared, and capable, first in law and now in coaching. Recovery has required you to relinquish some control and accept help. Meanwhile, impulsive eating is another place where control feels slippery. And in your relationship, you’re working on new patterns of communication. Does it feel like these are connected in any way?”

**Exploration questions:**

- “What’s your relationship with being ‘the one who has it together’? Where did you learn that role?”
- “What happens inside you when you can’t meet your own expectations—whether about eating, recovery timelines, or anything else?”
- “How comfortable are you with asking for what you need versus figuring everything out yourself?”

-----

## Goal Setting & Homework (5-7 minutes)

**Script:**
“As we wrap up, what feels like the most useful focus for the coming week or two?”

*[Collaborate on 1-2 specific, achievable goals]*

**Suggested homework options:**

- “Keep a brief log of impulsive eating moments—just what you were doing/feeling right before, no judgment”
- “Notice one moment this week when you accept help or limitation with self-compassion”
- “Identify one thing from couples counseling to practice”
- “Journal about what coaching means to your identity”

**Script:**
“What feels doable given where you are in recovery? Let’s make sure this supports you rather than becoming another expectation to meet perfectly.”

-----

## Closing (3-5 minutes)

**Script:**
“Before we finish, what’s landing with you from today? What are you taking away?”

*[Listen, validate, reflect]*

“You’re navigating a lot right now—physical recovery, relationship growth, career identity, ADHD management—and you’re showing up consistently to do this work. That matters, and I want you to acknowledge that for yourself.”

**Scheduling:**
“When should we meet next? How are you feeling about the frequency of our sessions right now?”

“Is there anything you need from me before you go?”

## Therapist Self-Reflection Notes

After session, consider:

- What defenses or patterns emerged?
- Where did she show vulnerability or resistance?
- What countertransference came up for me?
- What needs deeper exploration in future sessions?
- Is consultation or coordination with couples therapist appropriate?
